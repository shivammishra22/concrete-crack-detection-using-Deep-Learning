# Concrete-crack-detection-using-Deep-Learning

## Overview
This project leverages deep learning techniques to automatically detect cracks in concrete surfaces. The model is trained on image datasets containing both cracked and non-cracked concrete surfaces, enabling efficient and accurate identification of structural defects.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of concrete surfaces, categorized as:

- Cracked Concrete

- Non-Cracked Concrete

Preprocessing techniques such as image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation are applied to improve model performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python

- TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning Framework)

- OpenCV (Image Processing)

- NumPy & Pandas (Data Handling)

- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

- Jupyter Notebook

## Model Implementation

The deep learning model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The workflow includes:

1. Data Preprocessing: Image augmentation and normalization.

2. Model Architecture: CNN-based architecture to extract features and classify images.

3. Training & Validation: Using a dataset split for better generalization.

4. Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Testing & Predictions: Evaluating model performance on unseen images.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/concrete-crack-detection.git

### Navigate to the project directory
cd concrete-crack-detection

### Install required dependencies
